## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned that when you're doing a mobile-first workflow, in your media queries, you will use min-width to apply styles to sizes that are BIGGER than what you specified. Conversely, you will do the opposite when you are starting with a desktop-first workflow -> use max-width to apply styles to elements that are LESSER than the max-width you specified.

### Continued development

Still need to continue to get comfortable with media queries and setting the best sizes for my projects.

What size do we use for media queries when given the mobile, tablet, and desktop versions on Figma?

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K24lUqcT0Ms) - This helped me understand media queries a bit more and how to apply them in a pattern like way.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGYUT0xkmaU&list=PL0-e1OMq5RP4BIrTQPrqu6Jxsfp94xK8Z&index=2) - This is an amazing video that helped me decide what units to use when creating my projects.
